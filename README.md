# Trex-Runner-Game
This is a TRex Runner game similar to Google's "no wifi" trex runner game. 

# How to Run the Program  #

1) Go to the project folder 
2) Go into the source folder 
3) Run App.java 

In my project folder I have included various objects in the game such as a TRex, Cactus, Cloud, Fireball, etc.
